Shorts Forms

ARN - Amazon Resource Number
REST API - representational state transfer
SOAP - Simple object access protocol
SAML 2.0 - Security Assertion Markup Language
OIDC - Open ID Connect
OAuth - Authorization Framework for APIs

---------------------------------------------------------------
JWT - JSON Web Token can call ID Token.

    JWT - Its a token for OAuth with OIDC Framework
        Three required parameter of JWT -
            HEADER - ALGORITHM & TOKEN TYPE
            PAYLOAD - UserID, ID, Name
            VERIFY SIGNATURE - HMACSHA256

Access Token -
    credentials used to access protected resources.access token is put in the Authorization header of your request, usually looks like Bearer “access_token” that the API you are calling can verify and grant you access.

bearer Token -
    A bearer token means who holds the access token can access authorized resources without further identification.
    access token uses as bearer token

Flow of the Token -
    JWT (Request to web server) -> Access Token (Response from Server ) -> bearer Token (can access Authorized Resource)

https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/accesstoken-vs-id-token-vs-refresh-token-what-whywhen/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REST API (its not a protocol) - Uses JWT

    REST is a set of guidelines that offers flexible implementation.
    contract between an information provider (Respond) and an information user (The Call)

    For example, the API design for a weather service could specify that the user supply a zip code and that the producer reply with a 2-part answer, the first being the high temperature, and the second being the low. follows A client-server architecture.
https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api

SOAP (Its a protocol) - uses SAML
    designed for applications built with different languages and on different platforms could communicate.maintain By WWW.
    can be compliance with ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) property.

    eg.
        <env:Envelope xmlns:env="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope">
            <env:Header>
                <n:alertcontrol xmlns:n="http://example.org/alertcontrol">
                <n:priority>1</n:priority>
                <n:expires>2001-06-22T14:00:00-05:00</n:expires>
                </n:alertcontrol>
            </env:Header>
            <env:Body>
                <m:alert xmlns:m="http://example.org/alert">
                <m:msg>Pick up Mary at school at 2pm</m:msg>
                </m:alert>
            </env:Body>
        </env:Envelope>
