Risk - A potential Problem
Threat - its path to risk occurring
Mitigation - countermeasure against the Threat

Threat Modeling - process of identifying and enumerating the potential threats to a system.
Container Threat Model -
    External attackers - attempting to access a deployment from outside
    Internal attackers - who have managed to access some part of the deployment
    Malicious internal actors -  such as developers and administrators who have some level of privilege to access the deployment.
    Inadvertent internal actors -  who may accidentally cause problems
    Application processes - that, while not sentient beings intending to compromise your system, might have programmatic access to the system.
